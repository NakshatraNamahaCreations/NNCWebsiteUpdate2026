    { n: '01', h3: '5–10× faster to build than a native mobile app', body: 'A PWA is built on web technology. No separate iOS Swift codebase, no Android Kotlin codebase. One team, one sprint, one delivery.' },
    { n: '02', h3: 'No app store approval go live in hours', body: 'App store reviews take 2–7 days and can reject your submission. A PWA deploys directly to a URL. Updates go live instantly.' },
    { n: '03', h3: 'Users install without leaving your website', body: 'The install prompt appears on your site. No app store page to maintain, no screenshots, no store description just your URL.' },
    { n: '04', h3: 'Significant cost saving over native development', body: 'A native iOS + Android app requires two separate codebases. A PWA requires one. The cost difference is typically 60–70%.' },
    { n: '05', h3: 'Indexable by Google native apps are not', body: "Every page of your PWA is crawlable and rankable. Your native app's content is invisible to search engines. PWAs win on organic discovery." },
    { n: '06', h3: 'Works on every device no download barrier', body: "Users access your PWA via a URL. No Play Store account, no 200MB download. Instant access is the highest-converting onboarding." },

  h2Faq: 'Progressive Web App Development Frequently Asked Questions',
  faqs: [
    { q: 'How much does PWA development cost?', a: 'PWAs at NNC start from ₹45,000 for content-focused apps with offline access. Feature-rich PWAs with background sync, push notifications and device API access typically range from ₹75,000 to ₹2,00,000. All pricing is fixed before work begins.' },
    { q: 'Can a PWA replace a native mobile app?', a: "For most business applications yes. PWAs support push notifications, offline access, camera access and geolocation. The main limitation is deeper hardware access (Bluetooth, NFC, background audio) where a native app may still be needed. NNC will recommend the right approach for your use case." },
    { q: 'Do PWAs work on iPhone / iOS?', a: "Yes. iOS 16.4+ supports PWA push notifications. Older iOS supports installability and offline access. Android has had full PWA support since 2017. NNC tests every PWA across iOS Safari, Android Chrome and desktop browsers before delivery." },
    { q: 'Can users install the PWA without going to the App Store?', a: "Exactly that's the key advantage. On Android, a browser prompt ('Add to Home Screen') appears automatically when your PWA meets the installability criteria. On iOS, users tap Share → Add to Home Screen. No app store, no approval process." },
    { q: 'How is a PWA different from a mobile website?', a: "A PWA is a mobile website with app-layer capabilities: it's installable, works offline, can send push notifications and uses an app shell that loads instantly. A regular mobile website has none of these. The user experience of a well-built PWA is indistinguishable from a native app." },
    { q: 'Do you build the backend / API for the PWA as well?', a: "Yes. NNC is a full-stack team. We build the PWA frontend, the Node JS backend, the MongoDB or PostgreSQL database and the REST API all under one fixed-price scope. You don't need to manage a separate backend development team." },
