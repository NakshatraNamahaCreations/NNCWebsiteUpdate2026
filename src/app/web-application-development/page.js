  faqs: [
    { q: 'How much does web application development cost?', a: 'Web application costs at NNC range from ₹75,000 for simple MVP tools to ₹5,00,000+ for enterprise platforms. The price is always fixed after a scoping session no hourly billing, no sprint escalations. Request a discovery call for an accurate estimate.' },
    { q: 'How long does it take to build a web application?', a: 'Simple web apps (booking systems, portals) typically take 6–10 weeks. Mid-complexity SaaS platforms take 10–16 weeks. Full enterprise systems take 16–24+ weeks. All timelines are agreed upfront with weekly staging milestones.' },
    { q: 'Can you build an MVP first and scale it later?', a: 'Yes this is the most common pattern. NNC scopes an MVP with core features, delivers it on the agreed timeline, and then works with you on subsequent phases. Each phase has its own fixed price and scope.' },
    { q: 'Do you build multi-tenant SaaS platforms?', a: 'Yes. NNC has built multi-tenant platforms where each client organisation has isolated data, custom branding and role-based access. Architecture decisions are made based on your specific security and scale requirements.' },
    { q: 'What tech stack do you use for web applications?', a: "NNC's primary stack is React JS (frontend), Node JS / Express JS (backend), MongoDB or PostgreSQL (database) and AWS (hosting, storage, email). For complex real-time features we add Redis and WebSockets. The stack is chosen based on project requirements." },
    { q: 'Who owns the source code after delivery?', a: 'You do completely and permanently. Every source file, database schema, environment configuration, AWS access credentials and admin login is delivered to you at project close. No ongoing dependency on NNC.' },
