  h2Faq: 'Landing Page Development Frequently Asked Questions',
  faqs: [
    { q: 'How much does landing page development cost?', a: 'A single conversion landing page starts from ₹12,000. Multi-page funnels (landing page + thank-you page + upsell page) range from ₹25,000–₹60,000. All prices are fixed upfront. Ongoing CRO (A/B testing and optimisation) is available as a separate retainer.' },
    { q: 'How quickly can NNC deliver a landing page?', a: 'Standard landing pages are delivered within 5–7 working days from content receipt. For urgent campaign launches, NNC can deliver within 72 hours with prior arrangement. The 72-hour option requires all copy, brand assets and tracking IDs to be provided upfront.' },
    { q: 'Will the landing page score well on PageSpeed Insights?', a: "Yes PageSpeed 90+ is contractual on all NNC pages, including landing pages. A slow landing page destroys your quality score in Google Ads and raises your cost-per-click. NNC's pages consistently score 90–98 on mobile and desktop." },
    { q: 'Can NNC set up Google Ads conversion tracking?', a: 'Yes. NNC configures Google Tag Manager, Google Ads conversion events and Google Analytics 4 as standard on every landing page. Meta Pixel is also set up if you\'re running Meta campaigns. You receive full Tag Manager access.' },
    { q: 'Can I use the landing page for multiple campaigns?', a: 'Yes. NNC can build variant pages for different ad groups or audience segments each with different copy and CTAs all under one fixed-price scope. UTM parameters and source tracking are configured so you can measure each variant independently.' },
    { q: "What's the difference between a landing page and a homepage?", a: 'A homepage serves multiple audiences with multiple goals. A landing page has one message and one action designed to convert a specific type of visitor from a specific campaign. Landing pages have significantly higher conversion rates than sending ad traffic to a homepage.' },
