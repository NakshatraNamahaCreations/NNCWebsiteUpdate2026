  faqs: [
    { q: 'How much does custom CRM development cost?', a: 'Custom CRM projects at NNC are scoped individually. Simple CRMs (lead management + admin dashboard) start from ₹75,000. Mid-complexity platforms with WhatsApp automation, payment integration and multi-role access range from ₹1,50,000 to ₹3,00,000. Full enterprise platforms are scoped separately. All pricing is fixed upfront.' },
    { q: 'How long does it take to build a custom CRM?', a: 'Simple CRM with lead management and admin panel: 8–10 weeks. Mid-complexity with integrations, payment collection and automated messaging: 12–16 weeks. Full enterprise platform: 16–24+ weeks. All timelines are agreed upfront with weekly staging milestones.' },
    { q: 'Is a custom CRM better than Salesforce or Zoho?', a: "A custom CRM is better when your workflows are complex, unusual or don't fit neatly into an off-the-shelf system and when the ongoing licence cost makes ownership economically sensible. NNC will give you an honest recommendation. If Zoho or HubSpot genuinely fits your need at lower cost, we'll say so." },
    { q: 'Can you integrate our existing tools with the new CRM?', a: 'Yes. NNC builds API integrations with Tally, Zoho, Google Workspace, Slack, Razorpay, WhatsApp Business, SMS gateways, logistics APIs and any legacy system with a documented API. Integration scope is confirmed during the discovery session.' },
    { q: 'Can we add features to the CRM after delivery?', a: "Yes. After the initial delivery, NNC can develop additional modules, integrations or features as separate fixed-price scopes. You can also hand the codebase to your own internal team or any other developer there's no proprietary code or dependency on NNC." },
    { q: 'Will the CRM work on mobile for field teams?', a: 'Yes. All NNC CRM builds are mobile-responsive. Field sales agents, delivery staff and on-site teams can update leads, log visits, capture signatures and access the full CRM from their smartphone. We also build PWA layers that allow offline data entry synced when connectivity is restored.' },
