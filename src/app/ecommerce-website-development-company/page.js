  faqs: [
    { q: 'How much does an e-commerce website cost?', a: 'E-commerce websites at NNC start from ₹45,000. The price depends on number of products, variants, integrations and custom features required. All pricing is fixed before work starts no hourly billing, no surprise invoices for payment gateway setup or product import.' },
    { q: 'How long does it take to build an e-commerce website?', a: 'A standard e-commerce store typically takes 5–8 weeks from design to launch. Larger platforms with multi-vendor support or complex inventory management may take 10–14 weeks. Timelines are agreed upfront.' },
    { q: 'Can you migrate my existing Shopify or WooCommerce store?', a: 'Yes. NNC has migrated multiple stores from Shopify, WooCommerce and Magento. We handle product data migration, URL structure preservation (to protect SEO rankings) and full feature parity before switching over.' },
    { q: 'Which payment gateway do you recommend for Indian e-commerce?', a: 'For India-first stores, NNC recommends Razorpay it supports UPI, credit/debit cards, net banking, EMI and wallets in one integration. International stores or those needing multi-currency support can use Stripe. Both are configured by NNC as standard.' },
    { q: 'Do I own the source code of my e-commerce store?', a: 'Yes completely and permanently. On delivery you receive every source file, database schema, admin credentials and hosting logins. No Shopify-style monthly fees. No SaaS dependency. Your store is 100% yours.' },
    { q: 'Can the e-commerce site handle large product catalogues?', a: "Yes. NNC's e-commerce architecture is designed to handle thousands of products with variants, filters and search without performance degradation. We've built stores with 10,000+ SKUs that still score 90+ on PageSpeed." },
